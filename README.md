# EmotionsDetector
EmotionsDetector is a little software I wrote to look into non-WIMP user interfaces. The program once run requests access to use the camera
and tries to to read the user's emotions using Affectiva API. It then assigns a link to a webpage, youtube video or playlist based on the emotions that it processed.
It is written in HTML and JS
